Based on my research, here's the information regarding the Xiaomi Lite Light's connectivity and control methods:

Connectivity Methods: The Xiaomi Smart Home Hub 2, which is likely compatible with the Xiaomi Lite Light, supports a variety of connection protocols. It can connect with Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Bluetooth, and Matter devices​​. This variety allows for flexibility in setting up and integrating the Xiaomi Lite Light into various smart home systems.

Control Methods - MQTT Protocol: The Xiaomi devices, including the Lite Light, can be controlled using the MQTT protocol. A specific service, lumimqtt, allows controlling gateway LEDs, buttons, and illuminance sensors over MQTT​​. The control actions include reading the light state, switching the light on or off, setting the light color, setting brightness, and reading illuminance​​.https://github.com/openlumi/lumimqtt The configuration file for the MQTT service includes parameters such as MQTT host, port, user, password, and topic root​​.

Control Methods - miIO and MIoT Protocols: Xiaomi's miIO and MIoT protocols are used for controlling their smart devices, including the Lite Light. The python-miio library and its accompanying CLI tool, miiocli, are used for this purpose​​. To control devices through this method, you first need to acquire tokens using the miiocli cloud command, which fetches them from your cloud account​​. Once you have the token, you can start controlling the device using commands like info to get generic information​​. Modern MIoT devices are automatically supported by the genericmiot integration, which uses "miot spec" files to find out about supported features such as sensors, settings, and actions​​.

The common commands available for controlling devices include status to show the device state, set to change settings, actions to list available actions, and call to execute actions​​. For instance, executing status will display the current device state and accepted values for settings​​. To change a setting, you need to provide the name of the setting, like light:brightness​​. Most devices also offer actions like toggling the light, adjusting brightness, which can be executed using the call command​​.

These methods provide comprehensive control over the Xiaomi Lite Light, catering to various user preferences and integration requirements in smart home setups.
